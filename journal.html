Journal Entry 1: 10/4/21 <br>
So far, I have learned a lot in CS1. I have learned that there are different ways to code. I have learned a lot about html. I learned how to put an image on a website. I also learned how to change the size of an image or text on a website, and how to make that image or text have a link.  I am feeling good about it. I think that it is pretty cool that I was able to create some of the stuff that I was able to create. Right now I am working on my first website that will lead to the other websites I make. I am excited to make new websites, but I am a little bit frustrated by the process in general because sometimes I will do something wrong, but I wonâ€™t be able to understand what I did wrong for a while. My goals for the next week or two are to gain a good understanding of creating a website and how to do it. Right now it is a little confusing, so hopefully it will make sense in one to two weeks.

Journal Entry 2: 10/13/21 <br>
I have made a lot more progress with my website, and it is now online. It's really cool to see that what I am doing on my computer shows up on google, and I can see it on my phone or on my friend's laptop. So far, the whole process has been really rewarding. Things are making more sense and I want to add more to my website. CS1 is going well.

Jounral Entry 3: 10/21/21 <br>
This week I made my animation. We only had one class this week. My animation is Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum moving around. I made it because the NBA came back this week. I feel alright about the animation. I don't think it was the greatest thing in the world, but it isn't awful. I'm also not completely sure how to get my animation on my projects page or how to get this journal entry online but I'm going to ask at the next class. I've learned how to animate things and about CSS. I'm not really frusturated about anything, but I am confused about how to update my website. Things are going well.

<h1> These are my journal entries</h1>

<div class="entry">Journal Entry 1: 10/4/21
So far, I have learned a lot in CS1. I have learned that there are different ways to code. I have learned a lot about html. I learned how to put an image on a website. I also learned how to change the size of an image or text on a website, and how to make that image or text have a link.  I am feeling good about it. I think that it is pretty cool that I was able to create some of the stuff that I was able to create. Right now I am working on my first website that will lead to the other websites I make. I am excited to make new websites, but I am a little bit frustrated by the process in general because sometimes I will do something wrong, but I won’t be able to understand what I did wrong for a while. My goals for the next week or two are to gain a good understanding of creating a website and how to do it. Right now it is a little confusing, so hopefully it will make sense in one to two weeks.</div>

I have made a lot more progress with my website, and it is now online. It's really cool to see that what I am doing on my computer shows up on google, and I can see it on my phone or on my friend's laptop. So far, the whole process has been really rewarding. Things are making more sense and I want to add more to my website. CS1 is going well. </div>

This week I made my animation. We only had one class this week. My animation is Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum moving around. I made it because the NBA came back this week. I feel alright about the animation. I don't think it was the greatest thing in the world, but it isn't awful. I'm also not completely sure how to get my animation on my projects page or how to get this journal entry online but I'm going to ask at the next class. I've learned how to animate things and about CSS. I'm not really frusturated about anything, but I am confused about how to update my website. Things are going well. </div>

I think variable is the thing that a function is acted upon. I'm pretty sure when you create a function, the variable is what the function is happening to, so if the function is to move something, the variable is what is being moved. I believe a function is like a command made from pre existing words in java script. You use the words to make the function do what you want. You make a function actually run by writing a script section and then putting function, variable and what you want the function to do in that section. Some words in javascript that I've learned so far are variable, function, interval, and document. In my codesketch, the function is used to create an image of a whale over and over again. The function is really simple but it's cool. Happy Halloween</div>

		I've been learning more about javascript and event listeners. Right now I'm working on a gift where you can set a table with a bunch of different foods. You click on the food you want to select and then onto the table to put it where you want. I still have a lot to do, but hopefully it will be pretty cool. It's almost winter break 👍.

		I made a digital appreciation card before break. It uses an event listener to show the text, and I think it gave me a better understanding on how even listeners work. I was pretty confused about even listeners  before I made this project, but now I understand them better thanks to this project.

	Since my last journal entry, I made a virus game project and a karaoke project. They are both cool. I didn't really need to learn more about javascript to make them I just had to practice using javascript to accomlish different things. We have also been talking about technology in general and using our phones. We also took some photos. The weather is getting nicer but it is still kind of cold which is weird.</div>

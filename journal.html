Journal Entry 1: 10/4/21
So far, I have learned a lot in CS1. I have learned that there are different ways to code. I have learned a lot about html. I learned how to put an image on a website. I also learned how to change the size of an image or text on a website, and how to make that image or text have a link.  I am feeling good about it. I think that it is pretty cool that I was able to create some of the stuff that I was able to create. Right now I am working on my first website that will lead to the other websites I make. I am excited to make new websites, but I am a little bit frustrated by the process in general because sometimes I will do something wrong, but I wonâ€™t be able to understand what I did wrong for a while. My goals for the next week or two are to gain a good understanding of creating a website and how to do it. Right now it is a little confusing, so hopefully it will make sense in one to two weeks.
